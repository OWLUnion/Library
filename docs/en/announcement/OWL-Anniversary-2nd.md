# OWL Server 2nd Anniversary

ðŸ¥³ OWL Server turns 2 years old! How Time Flies! It has been two years since OWL Server (originally named Kupars's Server) published its first promotional post on MineBBS on September 20, 2020. OWL Server can develop better and better without the support of every player. When did you start playing OWL Server? What are your unforgettable memories at OWL Server? Who are some of the friends you've made through OWL Server? What is your favorite period of OWL Server? What do you think are the pros and cons of OWL Server? Come discuss it with us at OWL Square!
Time flies, and it is not only OWL Server that grows, but also ourselves. Thank you to every player for your company, and I hope OWL Server can always bring you endless happiness!
