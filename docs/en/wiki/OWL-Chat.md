# OWL Chat

## What is OWL Chat

OWL Chat is a two-way forwarding group chat for OWL Server, through which you can communicate with players in the server. You can join through the group number 925912611.

## Why canâ€™t I use OWL Chat?

The robot accounts used for chat communication are always blocked, so they are often unusable.
