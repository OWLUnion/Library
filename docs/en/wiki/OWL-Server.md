## What to do if you cannot enter the server?

### Outdated server

This is because your client version is higher than the OWL Server version. You can try downgrading your Minecraft version or waiting for OWL Server to update.

### Expired client

This is because your client version is lower than the OWL Server version. You can try updating your Minecraft.

### Unable to connect to server

You can try changing the network environment or changing the IP to the transit IP provided by OWL. If you still can't get in, please report it in OWL Square.

## How is the server performance?

The server is located in Hong Kong and is configured with 4 cores and 8GB of storage. The CPU-Z single-core running score is about 290 points, which can support smooth operation most of the time. Since the server is located in Hong Kong, latency may be higher in some areas.

## resource utilization
Each week of OWL Server has only one map. Players play together on the same map, develop freely, and build the future together. This also makes efficient use of maps even more important. Some players use plug-in tools to mine large amounts of minerals, while others use explosive items to destroy trees and land suitable for survival. Although these phenomena rarely occur, we still hope that players will work together to protect server resources and try not to discard or destroy resources in large quantities.

## Building transfer
OWL Server supports cross-project transfer of buildingsüè†
If you have a building or machine in another project that you're proud of, you can save it using a structure block in OWL Memories and export the file, then send it to us and request its placement in the current project. The buildings you transferred will be open to all players to visit and use in the new map.
