### Design concept

The world flag consists of three colors, namely blue, white and green, which symbolize the sky, clouds and grass respectively. We believe that these three bright colors come from nature and are the colors that best represent nature. These three colors together form a peaceful natural picture that is harmonious, simple, natural and elegant. This is in line with the concepts of Love & Freedom. Meanwhile, all three colors can be found in Minecraft.
